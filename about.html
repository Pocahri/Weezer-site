				<center><h2 class="memberNames">Brian Bell</h2></center>
				<p>Born in Iowa City, Iowa on December 9, 1968 and raised in Knoxville, Tennessee, Bell gravitated to music at the age of four when his parents took him to an Elvis Presley concert. Bell was forced by his mother to take piano lessons, and refused to let him take guitar lessons until high school because didn't believe he would practice. During his freshman year, his parents finally allowed him to take guitar lessons.
				</br>
				After graduating high school, Bell decided not to pursue higher education feeling it would be a "waste of money". In 1991, he became a member of Carnival Art, which released three offical albums with Bell playing bass. However, due to poor reception, Carnival Art was later dropped by the record label. Later, he quit and joined Weezer.

				<center><h2 class="memberNames">Patrick Wilson</h2></center>
				<p> Born in Buffalo, New York on February 1, 1969 and raised in nearby Clarence. Wilson was introduced to music very early on in life. After attending his first concert, he was inspired to learn to play the drums.
				</br>
				After graduating high school in 1987, Wilson briefly attended a local college; he dropped out after one semester. He commented, "...College is great if you want to learn, but that's not what college is about, it's about making your professor happy and getting good grades and getting into IBM. Any place that says that they're only accepting college graduates is not a place I'm very interested in being." At 21, he moved to Los Angeles and met Cuomo while playing for different bands.
